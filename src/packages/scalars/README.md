# `@exogee/graphql-scalars`

A package to house common scalar types used across GraphQL APIs.

A scalar is a custom value type used in GraphQL. For example, the Point scalar allows us to request latitude and longitude as a single
endpoint in the GraphQL query, which comes back as an object.

## Usage

Import the scalars you want to use, then specify them as the field type. For more information, see examples in `graphql-api`.

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation and usage examples can be found on our [Docs Site](https://graphweaver.com/docs). It covers installation instructions, detailed API documentation, and guides to help you get started with Graphweaver.
